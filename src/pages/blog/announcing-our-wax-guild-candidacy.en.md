## **Infrastructure**

Our infrastructure is ever expanding and evolving, and we operate many dedicated servers to provide a variety of services. We customize all of our hardware specifically for each application to ensure the absolute best performance.

To facilitate this, we have a multi-year lease with a Tier 3 data center which provides us with power redundancy, multiple independent internet connections, within a facility that is physically secured to prevent unauthorized access.

Our fleet of dedicated servers is comprised of components which provide the maximum throughput for each specific task. Currently we leverage high single-core clock speed processors, high volumes of RAM, and the fastest hard drives on the market. As an example, our most recent acquisition, which is being built to serve as a full history node for the EOS Mainnet, has the following specifications:


CPU:
* Intel Xeon Gold 6244 (Cascade Lake Gen2, 8 cores @ 4.4 GHz)

RAM:
* 768 GB DDR4 ECC

Storage:
* 3D Xpoint (Optane) PCIE: 1.5 TB x4
* 3D Xpoint (Optane) M.2: 380 GB x3
* SATA SSD: 4 TB x4


This server will be coming online very soon to add further redundancy to the full history nodes we already operate for the EOS blockchain.

## **Scaling Infrastructure**

The approach we take on scaling EOSIO based blockchains is iterative - in that we continually are researching, testing, and deploying some of the newest hardware to keep pace with the growth of each blockchain we operate. As each chain grows, our infrastructure grows with it, with older generations of hardware being recycled back into the system with new purpose.

Beyond scaling hardware to meet demands, we also build custom software solutions on top of that hardware to help extend its lifespan. Utilizing various methods of data compression, caching, and actual software optimization - we are able to provide some of the fastest and most scalable solutions found anywhere within the EOSIO ecosystem. We are proud to operate some of the fastest block production nodes on any network, as well as some of the most trafficked and fastest public API services.

Finally, the last piece of our infrastructure is the usage of select cloud platforms to provide a more globally distributed network. All mission critical resources are operated on our own servers within our specifically designed network, but we operate less critical services through multiple dedicated servers within the cloud. These servers ultimately rely on our data center for portions of their data, but are able to serve the majority of responses responses much faster when they are physically located closer to the end user.

A significant portion of the Greymass budget is allocated to hardware and networking expenses. Within our last year of operations, we have invested around $100k (USD) into building and scaling our infrastructure.

## **Thoughts on Governance**

We believe that validators on EOSIO networks have two core responsibilities— providing reliable and secure chain infrastructure, and participating in network governance. Validators (whether BPs, guilds, or other forms) serve as the elected representatives of the community, and they are tasked with guiding the evolution of the network and creating value in line with the desires of the token holders, who are the collective owners of the network. We believe that block producers should be proactive in offering leadership and opinions on important governance issues, and we also believe that they should utilize tools like referendum wherever available to more accurately gauge community sentiment.

## **Thoughts on Transparency and Accountability**

As our  [code of conduct](https://greymass.com/code_of_conduct)  makes clear, we hold ourselves to an extremely high standard when it comes to transparency, accountability, and community trust. We believe in high levels of transparency not just in our actions within the community, but also with our products and services. All of our code is open-source, and security audits are welcome.

## Thoughts on Security 

The sovereignty, privacy, and security of blockchain is one of our top priorities; both in terms of the operations of the network (as a block producer) and for the end-user (in developing a wallet and APIs).

The blockchain itself must be operated by professionals who understand these concepts and the impact of their own actions. The actual block production itself must be performed in an unbiased and secure manner, with proper redundancy and management of it’s security. For each network we participate in, we operate this service on physically secured servers with restricted access and the highest levels of key management.

On the end-user side, we also put serious consideration into how best to secure their assets and maintain privacy. We have developed and released a secure open-source wallet for anyone to use with any EOSIO-based blockchain and continually seek ways to improve it. This wallet has specifically been designed to operate with only a single connection to the specified blockchain, using only native APIs and no external calls to help ensure privacy with its use. To that end we also operate a number of public “no-log” API servers, which anyone can use to access the network without the fear of any sort of invasion of privacy.


## **Community Benefit Projects**


[Anchor Wallet](https://blog.greymass.com/eos/@greymass/the-future-of-the-greymass-wallet-beta-version-available-now)

Anchor Wallet (previously called eos-voter) is an EOSIO desktop wallet that allows users to safely and easily take advantage of the full suite of features of the EOSIO software. We have integrated WAX as a native option so that WAX users are able to safely and easily do things like send and receive tokens, manage resources, participate in governance, and much more.

**Native History APIs** /  [Light History](https://blog.greymass.com/eos/@greymass/introducing-light-history-nodes-for-eos) 

At Greymass, APIs are one of our specialties. Not only are we one of the few block producers running native history APIs on the EOS mainnet, but we also developed the light history solution used by a number of other BPs today. If elected, we plan to bring both of these infrastructure solutions to the WAX blockchain.

**DApp Middleware and Infrastructure**

We’re currently working on a dApp middleware and infrastructure layer that will include a number of important projects. The first is our  [EEP7 signing protocol](https://github.com/greymass/EEPs/blob/eep-x/EEPS/eep-7.md) , a new protocol that allows for easy communication between applications and signature providers, with the ability to request specific transaction templates. In the future, we’ll continue to work on projects that make using the blockchain more easy and secure for both developers and end users. Each of these projects will be generalizable to EOSIO and can be easily made to support WAX.

More of our projects can be seen on our  [Github page](https://github.com/greymass) .

Thank you for your support! We look forward to being a part of the WAX ecosystem!
