We’re no strangers to block production, having served as block producers or witnesses for a number of chains including Steem, Golos, Decent, Peerplays, Muse, and Karma. We've also developed a number of tools and services that enhance the user experience on these chains, including Steemcleaners, Cheetah, Guard, SteemDB, Vessel, ChainBB, Chainsync, Chainmodel, Reprint, and more.

EOS, like Ethereum when it first launched, has no enforced purpose. Like any open source software, it’s up to developers and the end users to give it purpose and utility. We think EOS has incredible potential and we know we can help speed that process up. Our commitment to voters is that Greymass has the infrastructure and expertise to serve as a world class block producer while simultaneously improving the value of the chain itself.

Below is our roadmap for EOS in 2018. We hope to build a lot more cool stuff throughout the year and well into the future, but this is the minimum commitment we’re making to everyone willing to vote us in as a top block producer.
